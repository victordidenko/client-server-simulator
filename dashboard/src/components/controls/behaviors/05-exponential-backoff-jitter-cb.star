# Exponential backoff with jitter and circuit breaker
# Circuit breaker opens after consecutive failures and prevents further requests
# Note: This uses global state to track circuit breaker across all clients
#
# - Implements a global circuit breaker that opens after consecutive failures
# - Prevents requests when circuit is open (recovery timeout)
# - Uses half-open state to test server recovery with limited requests
# - Automatically closes circuit after successful half-open requests
# - Protects server from continued load when it's struggling
